# web_scraping
Web Scraping Example

In this web scraping example, we have scrapped a website and store the table content in a Dataframe. We have used the bs4 library to get the contents of the url.

url = 'https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/budgets-and-reports/legislative-reports/2013-14-legislative-session.html'
